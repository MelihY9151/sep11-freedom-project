## Implications
If people were to see the benifical implications of the research of nuclear tech they would push goverments to invest and increase the buget of the research of this science. 

One way this site will impact the world is that people will get a minimal biased site that will inform them of the benifets and the possible cons of this tech in day to day use and other less noble uses like wepons of mass distruction. The education system in the us olny teaches kids of the use of nuclear tech in war and how devistating it was to the japanese citizens. The education system also empisizes the kid of very few nuclear disators in japan and ukraine. 

If the education system decides to force less biased lesson and talks about the pros of this tech we could make new strides in curing canser and other diseases as well as researching more safty procations to be used in nuclear power reactors and puting limitations on the contries that will have acsess to this information.
