The need for the freedom project was to help 11th graders find information on stem which will be very relevant in the future of mankind. The purpose of this site is to help spread information on nuclear tech that has a minimal amount of bias politicly. I will talk about the many discrepancies on nuclear tech and both the pros and cons how this tech has been used and how it is used now in the 21st century. I have a great interest in nuclear science since it has a high demand and works related to this pay a large salary. 

This tech has a large some of benefits and a large amount of cons in daily life and as a product of war. This tech has affected how the tech has helped many governments improve their security using the overwhelming power of nuclear wepons.How ever thistech has also caused the rise of current issues since some countries that had certain problem in the surrounding area that could result in a nuclear war like how Korea constantly tests icbms in the sea of japan. This implication has resulted in a negative view in nuclear technology around the world limiting our ability to research it for medical uses.
