The need for the freedom project was to help 11th graders find information on stem which will be very relevant in the future of mankind. The purpose of this site is to help spread information on nuclear technology  that has a minimal amount of bias political. 

I will talk about the many discrepancies on nuclear technology  and both the pros and cons of how this technology  has been used and how it is used now in the 21st century. I have a great interest in nuclear science since it has a high demand and works related to this pay a large salary. 

This technology  has a large some of benefits and a large amount of cons in daily life and as a product of war. This technology  has affected how the technology  has helped many governments improve their security using the overwhelming power of nuclear wepons.How ever thistechnowlegy  has also caused the rise of current issues since some countries that had certain problem in the surrounding area that could result in a nuclear war like how Korea constantly tests icbms in the sea of japan. This implication has resulted in a negative view in nuclear technology the technology around the world limiting our ability to research it for medical uses.

I've used multiple sources to get a basic idea about the implementation of nuclear technology  in our lives and medical uses. The article comes from the world nuclear association. This is one of the most reputable sources since it is not tied to any form of government that would force them to change their information. This site also has links to talk about the negative impact of radiation on the human body and the environment as used improperly can cause severe genetic abnormalities including cancer. Finding this information had ignited an interest toward this technology .Another factor to my interest in nuclear science was learning about nuclear science in chemistry class.

At first I wanted to make my site on aeronautical engineering but there was too great of a following for this technology so I instead decided to make one based on a conventional topic that many people are ill informed about however make arguments based on it on blind ambitions without thinking of all the benefits of this technology. Whit out this site people many always have a negative view of nuclear technology limiting the research fund and improvements to lives.
